# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Registration

In order to run Lexibot, we need to create an AWS account. Lexibot utilizes AWS's language processing engine called Lex. 

Note that AWS offers free 1-year trial for new users, but we do need to enter our credit/debit card information during signup. 

### 1. Navigate to AWS Website
Visit https://aws.amazon.com/ and click on the "Create A Free Account" button.
